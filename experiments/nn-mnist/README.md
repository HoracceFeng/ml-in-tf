This experiment takes a very simple and straight forward approach of training a Neural Network to classify the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), consisting of handwritten numbers from 0-9 saved in 28x28 images. Here's what a sample of what the numbers in MNIST look like:

## Get Started
To get started, use the terminal to navigate to ```ml-in-tf/experiments/nn-mnist/```and run ```python nn-mnist.py```.

To see the graph and plots using ```tensorboard```, use the terminal to navigate to ```ml-in-tf/``` and run ```tensorboard --logdir logs/```. Wait for the following message:

```
Starting TensorBoard on port <port>
```
And then open up a browser and go to ```localhost:<port>```.


## Network
The network in this experiment has one fully connected layer. It takes every single image pixel as input represented as a one-dimensional of size 784 (=28x28) and outputs a softmax layer of size 10, one for each number-class.

| Input | Output  |
|:-----:|:-------:|
|784    | 10      | 



## Results
The implementation is really straight forward and should receive an accuracy of â‰ˆ 88% on the test set.
