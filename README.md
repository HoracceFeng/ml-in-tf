# Machine Learning in TensorFlow

The purpose of this repository is to offer anyone who wants to get started with using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) a number of experiments, where the same problem is solved through different techniques, showcasing different methods of approaching the same problem. 

The implementations and parameters aren't necessarily optimized to solve the problem, since that isn't the purpose, but rather serve as a solid starting ground to play around with for your own experiments and optimizations!

It is currently under construction, but if you have any feedback, suggestions or comments - I'd gladly hear it!
