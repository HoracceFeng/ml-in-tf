# Machine Learning in TensorFlow

The purpose of this repo is to offer anyone who wants to get started with using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) a number of examples to get a kickstart with. They aren't necessarily optimized on solving the problem, since that isn't the purpose, but rather serve as a starting ground to play around with for your own experiments and optimizations!

It is currently under construction, but if you have any feedback or comments, I'd gladly hear them!
